Init scripts for initializing the basic structures for fetching the full source code to build a working LineageOS ROM or TWRP image.

These files should be placed in the corresponding <working_directory>, for example the file "init_los14.sh" should be placed in a directory named los14.

Give the init scripts the execution permission (chmod +x) and execute them, for example by typing:
```
cd <working_directory>
./init_los14.sh
```

This may take a lot of time depending on your internet speed and the amount of fetched files.

Please grab a coffee and relax meanwhile...
